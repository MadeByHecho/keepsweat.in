        <title>Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Working out isn’t easy.  Since I stopped playing sports in high school it’s become one of those things I know I should do but for one reason or another don’t.  The reasons are many and varying: I think I don’t have enough time, I’m intimidated by traditional gyms, I don’t see progress fast enough, I’m too tired, and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m particularly unique in this feeling and you can probably relate to one or all of my reasons for not working out.  The thing is I no longer want to accept that.  I no longer want to feel like I don’t have time to work out, I no longer want to be forced to feel judged and intimidated by all the fit guys in the gym around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m building a business that solves those problems, not only for myself but for everybody else that’s not working out as much as they should.  That’s where &lt;a href=&quot;http://keepsweat.in&quot;&gt;SWEAT.&lt;/a&gt; comes in.  Right now it’s a simple Apple TV app that I built over the last 5 weeks but over time it’ll be all that you need to start sweating, one drop at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
