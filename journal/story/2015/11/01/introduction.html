      <p>Working out isn’t easy.  Since I stopped playing sports in high school it’s become one of those things I know I should do but for one reason or another don’t.  The reasons are many and varying: I think I don’t have enough time, I’m intimidated by traditional gyms, I don’t see progress fast enough, I’m too tired, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m particularly unique in this feeling and you can probably relate to one or all of my reasons for not working out.  The thing is I no longer want to accept that.  I no longer want to feel like I don’t have time to work out, I no longer want to be forced to feel judged and intimidated by all the fit guys in the gym around me.</p>

<p>I’m building a business that solves those problems, not only for myself but for everybody else that’s not working out as much as they should.  That’s where <a href="http://keepsweat.in">SWEAT.</a> comes in.  Right now it’s a simple Apple TV app that I built over the last 5 weeks but over time it’ll be all that you need to start sweating, one drop at a time.</p>
